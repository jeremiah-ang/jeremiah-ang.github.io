        <h1> - Bubble Sort -</h1>

        <p>
            Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity both Ðž(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted<br />
            When compared to other sorting techniques, it is observed that Bubble Sort tend to have poorer performance.<br />
            There exist other algorithm such as Heap Sort that has better worst-case or average complexity of O(n log n)
        </p>
        <p>
            in a 0-based array, bubblesort simple takes one element and compare with the immediate neighbour and is swapped if its of given favourable condition.<br />
            Bubble sort is one of the easiest sorting algorithm to understand and implement, thus making it not as efficient.

                This was a project done during my holiday where I wanted to expand my skills and learn something new, upon learning sorting techniques, I thought it would be more fun and interesting to create an 'animatable' version while creating a deeper understanding of the sorting technique. Hope this would help you in some way or another.
